# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence is “the science and engineering of making intelligent machines,” as defined by computer scientist John McCarthy in 1956.
AI is sometimes called Machine Intelligence, referring to the fact that the capacity for reasoning and understanding is bound by the limits of a machine and its contents. 
Natural Intelligence is what is exhibited by humans, bound by the limits of our cognitive functions.
AI, in its current state, could be said to be computers or programs that attempt to mimic human intelligence through displays of reasoning, learning, analyzing, and problem-solving.
